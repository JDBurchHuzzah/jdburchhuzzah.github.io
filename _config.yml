title: JD Burch
bio: Hello! I am JD Burch! I am a high school senior. I play Bass Clarinet, as well as Tenor Sax! I earned a Division 1 rating at the MSBOA State Solo and Ensemble Festival multiple times on Bass Clarinet, and was also accepted into the MSBOA District 4 Honors Band in 2023! I am auditioning for the 2024 MSBOA All State Symphony Orchestra. I am a All Confrence Varsity Swimmer in the 100 Butterfly and 100 Breastroke. I am very active in the Relay FM Members Discord, and subscribe to Connected Pro. I am a very avid listener to most other Relay shows as well. I enjoy technology, and have a deep knowledge and interest of Apple. Testing a new theme
