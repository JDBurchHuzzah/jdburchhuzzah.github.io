Hello! I am JD Burch!

I am a high school senior.

I play Bass Clarinet, as well as Tenor Sax! I earned a Division 1 rating at the MSBOA State Solo and Ensemble Festival multiple times on Bass Clarinet, and was also accepted into the MSBOA District 4 Honors Band in 2023! I am  auditioning for the 2024 MSBOA All State Symphony Orchestra.

I am a All Confrence Varsity Swimmer in the 100 Butterfly and 100 Breastroke.

I am very active in the [Relay FM](https://relay.fm) Members Discord, and subscribe to [Connected Pro](https://relay.fm/connected). I am a very avid listener to most other Relay shows as well.

I enjoy technology, and have a deep knowledge and interest of Apple.
