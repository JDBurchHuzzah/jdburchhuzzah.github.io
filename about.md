<center> <p>Hello! I am JD Burch!</p>
<a href:"#band">Band</a>
</center>

<h2 id="band">Day Band</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
  <h4>Symphony Band; Bass Clarinet</h4>
  <p>In 2022 and 2023 we earned a Division Rating II at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd1X7nPsM4Q">MSBOA</a> District Festival. My favorite song we have played is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeFiOnbKYcc">Danzon No. 2</a> by Arturo MÃ¡rquez, with a close second being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd1X7nPsM4Q">Stella Maris</a> by Samuel R. Hazo.</p><br>
  <h4>Concert Band; Tenor Saxophone</h4>
  <p>I joined Concert Band this year to learn and improve my Tenor Sax skills, as I will be auditioning for the University of Michigan Marching Band on Tenor Sax.</p><br>

<h2>Marching Band</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
  <h4>High School Marching Band</h4>
  <p>I am a Captain of the Single Reeds Section in the SLEHS Marching Band, and play Bass Clarinet. Our marching band is in the <a href="https://www.themcba.org">MCBA</a> Flight II, and we were state finalists in 2021 and 2022. We are well on our way to being a state finalist again in 2023!</p><br>
  <h4>College Marching Band</h4>
  <p>I am planning on auditioning for the marching band wherever I go to college! I am learning Tenor Sax to play in college marching band!</p><br>

<h2>Small Ensembles</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
  <h4>Duets</h4>
  <p>In 2022, I played in a Clarinet and Bass Clarinet duet with a friend at MSBOA District and State Solo and Ensemble, earning a Division I Rating at both events.<br><br>In 2023, I played in a Bass Clarinet-Tenor Sax duet (I played Bass Clarinet) with another friend at MSBOA District and State Solo and Ensemble, earning a Division I Rating at both events as well.<br><br>In 2024, I will be playing in a Clarinet-Bass Clarinet duet with yet another friend at District Solo and Ensemble, with the hopes of going to states.</p><br>
  <h4>Clarinet Choir</h4>
  <p>In Fall 2022, I joined our school sponsored Clarinet Ensemble. We performed at our school's Winter Concert, Spring Concert, and for a nursing home. We earned a 1 at District Solo and Ensemble, and unfortunately got disqualified at State Solo and Ensemble due to not covering all the parts in the piece; however, we did get glowing comments from the judge! This year, we will be performing at District (and hopefully State) Solo and Ensemble, as well as various concerts like last year.</p><br>
  <h4>Sax Choir</h4>
  <p>In Fall 2023, I joined Sax Choir to keep improving on Tenor Sax! We will be performing at the same events as Clarinet Choir!</p><br>
  <h4>Mixed Woodwind Ensemble</h4><p>Our program is in the process of adding a Woodwind Ensemble as a sucsessor to the late Woodwind Quintet (everybody in it graduated). More details will come later!</p><br>

<h2>Swimming</h2>
<p>I am a Captain on the South Lyon Varsity Swim and Dive Team. I mainly swim the 100 Breastroke and the 100 Butterfly. I have been Varsity all 4 years of high school.</p>

<h2>Scouts - Youth</h2> 
<div style="margin-left: 25px;"> <h4>Trail to Eagle - Blue Troop</h4>
 
  <p>In 2019, I joined Blue Troop at Trail to Eagle. Trail to Eagle is a very unique summer camp that takes place once a week. Scouts from across Michigan and the Country are seperated into one of eight differnet troops named after a color. I was in Blue Troop for 5 years as a youth. In 2021, I was asked to be a Junior Assistant Scoutmaster. I served as a JASM for two years. Trail to Eagle 2022 was one of the best weeks of my life! I earned over 25 merit badges over the 4 years I was at TTE!</p><br>

  <div style="margin-left: 25px;"> <h4>Eagle Scout Project</h4>
    <p>In the summer of 2022, I completed my Eagle Scout Project. This patio was just under 100 square feet. It took months of planning and around 75 hours of personal service. I fundraised by organizing a can drive during the week of the Fourth of July on my grandma's street (she lives on a lake, so it was a great location). I also got funds from Thrivent Credit Union through a member of my church.</p><br></div>

<h2>Misc. Podcasts</h2>
<p>I listen to quite a few podcasts on random topics, such as strange Wikipedia entries and defining obscure topics!</p>

<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
<h4>My Misc. Podcasts</h4>
<p><a href="https://rebelforceradio.com">Rebel Force Radio:</a> This podcast, hosted by Jason Swank and Jimmy Mac, goes into extreme depth on all things Star Wars, which is perfect for a Star Wars nerd like me. They make 2hr+ podcast episodes after every single Star Wars episode drops, and they also have a weekly show with more broad Star Wars content.
<p><a href="https://relay.fm/ungeniused">Ungeniused:</a> A short podcast that covers weird and wacky Wikipedia Topics, hosted by Myke Hurley and Stephen Hackett</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/robot/">Robot or Not:</a> This show is a fun banter show where John Siracusa and Jason Snell debate if something is a robot or not, and has since expanded to deciding if X is Y or not, with vaious subjects.</p>
