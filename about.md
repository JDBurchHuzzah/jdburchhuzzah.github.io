  <h4>Symphony Band; Bass Clarinet</h4>
  In 2022 and 2023 we earned a Division Rating II at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd1X7nPsM4Q">MSBOA</a> District Festival. My favorite song we have played is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeFiOnbKYcc">Danzon No. 2</a> by Arturo MÃ¡rquez, with a close second being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd1X7nPsM4Q">Stella Maris</a> by Samuel R. Hazo.

  <h4>Concert Band; Tenor Saxophone</h4>
  I joined Concert Band this year to learn and improve my Tenor Sax skills, as I will be auditioning for the University of Michigan Marching Band on Tenor Sax.
