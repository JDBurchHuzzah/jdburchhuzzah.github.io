<h2 id="jude">St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Fundraisers</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
  <p>Every September, <a href="https://relay.fm">Relay</a> organizes a fundraiser for <a href="https://stjude.org">St. Jude Children's Research Hospital</a>. This fundraiser raises an incredible amount of money each year. Their lifetime total is over $5 Million raised since!</p>
  <p>In 2022, they opened the fundraiser up for individual community members to have their own sub-campaigns. I started a campaign, and in my campaign, for qualifying donations, I would mow their name into a lawn before cutting the grass. I would dedicate that lawn to them and match a portion of their donation. <a href="https://jdburch.com/2022">2022's Fundraiser</a> raised $625.</p>
  <p>During September 2023, I ran a similar campaign again. That year, <a href="https://jdburch.com/2023">the campaign</a> raised $1,521.01, smashing my total from 2022 by nearly 3x.</p>
  <p>In 2024, <a href="https://jdburch.com/2023">I continued fundraising</a>, this time with different incentives, and raised $2,147.11.</p>
  <p>2025's <a href="https://jdburch.com/StJude25">Marching for St. Jude Fundraiser</a> raised a crazy $2,798.53, bringing the lifetime total raised to $7,091.65. This was an incredibly fun fundrasier to setup and run, and I enjoyed sharing my Michigan Marching Band experience while raising money for a great cause!</p>
