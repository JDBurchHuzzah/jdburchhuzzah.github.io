<h2 id="jude">St. Jude's Fundraisers</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
  <p>Every September, Relay FM organizes a huge fundraiser for St. Jude's Childrens Research hospital. This fundraiser raises an incredible amount of money each year. Their lifetime total is just shy of $3 Million over 5 years.</p>
  <p>To donate to my 2024 campaign, which is active now, please head <a href="https://jdburch.com/2024">here</a>. To read all about this year's campaign, please head to <a href="https://jdburch.com/StJude/">my blog post about it.</a></p>
  <p>In 2022, they opened the fundraiser up for individual community members to have their own sub-campaigns. I started a campaign, and in my campaign, if somebody donated $10 or more, I would mow their name into a lawn before cutting all the grass. I would dedicate that lawn to them and donate half of the money I earned from mowing that lawn. My fundraiser raised $625. The link to the fundraiser is <a href="https://jdburch.com/2022">here</a>.</p>
  <p>During September 2023, I ran a similar campaign with Relay FM again. This year, I donated my total earnings for 1 lawn for every $200 raised (up to $1000 raised). My campaign raised $1,521.01, smashing my total last near by nearly 3x. This link is <a href="https://jdburch.com/2023">here</a>. I am so proud of how much I have raised and I am incredibly impressed with the entire Relay FM community</p><br>

<h2>Scouts - Adult</h2>
<p>In 2024, I returned to Trail to Eagle as an Assistant Scoutmaster for Blue Troop, and a camp medical officer certified by the American Red Cross. I had a fantastic time, and will continue to return.</p><br>

<h2 id="scouts">Scouts - Youth</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;"> <h4>Trail to Eagle - Blue Troop</h4>
 
  <p>In 2019, I joined Blue Troop at Trail to Eagle. Trail to Eagle is a very unique summer camp that takes place once a week. Scouts from across Michigan and the country are seperated into one of eight differnet troops named after a color. I was in Blue Troop for 5 years as a youth. In 2021, I was asked to be a Junior Assistant Scoutmaster. I served as a JASM for two years. Trail to Eagle 2022 was one of the best weeks of my life! I earned over 25 merit badges over the 4 years I was at TTE!</p><br>

  <div style="margin-left: 25px;"> <h4>Eagle Scout Project</h4>
    <p>In the summer of 2022, I completed my Eagle Scout Project. This patio was just under 100 square feet. It took months of planning and around 75 hours of personal service. I fundraised by organizing a can drive during the week of the Fourth of July on my grandma's street (she lives on a lake, so it was a great location). I also got funds from Thrivent Credit Union through a member of my church.</p><br></div>

<h2 id="podcasts">Tech Podcasts</h2>
<p>I listen to many podcasts by <a href="https://relay.fm">Relay FM</a>. I am very active in the Relay FM Members discord, where I have met many friends over the past few years. Through the many tech podcasts I listen to, I have learned quite a bit about Apple and enjoy their products and business.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
<h4>My Tech Podcasts</h4>
<p><a href="https://relay.fm/connected">Connected:</a> My favorite podcast, a weekly panel with hosts from across the globe (and lots of japes). Hosted by Myke Hurley, Federico Viticci, and Stephen Hackett. I subscribe to Connected Pro, which gives me access to the Relay FM Members Discord, where I have met many friends throughout the years!</p>
<p><a href="https://relay.fm/upgrade">Upgrade:</a> A weekly tech podcast hosted by Jason Snell and Myke Hurley.</p>

<p><a href="https://relay.fm/radar">Under the Radar:</a> This show is 30 mintutes biweekly and hosted by David Smith and Marco Arment. This show discusses all aspects of indie iOS App Development, and even though I am not a developer, it is still very interesting to hear the developers discuss all things regarding how Apple impacts devs.</p>
<p><a href="https://relay.fm/cortex">Cortex:</a> This podcast isn't all tech, but doesn't really fit elsewhere. Hosted by CGP Grey and Myke Hurley, this podcast discusses their work lives and pretty much anything else they decide to talk about.</p>
<p><a href="https://relay.fm/downstream">Downstream:</a> This show is all about the Streaming Media industry, and is very interesting to me because I am very interested in business. Hosted by Jason Snell and Julia Alexander.</p><br>
</div>

<h2>Wondery Podcasts</h2>
<p>I also listen to many Wondery shows, thanks to my Dad. We used to listen to them in the car on the way to school, and now I am hooked. I subscribe to Wondery+.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
<h4>My Wondery Podcasts</h4>
<p><a href="https://wondery.com/shows/business-wars/">Business Wars:</a> This show has seasons of 4-6 epidodes detailing market battles between 2 companies. Hosted by David Brown.</p>
<p><a href="https://wondery.com/shows/business-movers/">Business Movers:</a> This show is similar to Business Wars, except it details the story of just one company through their life. Hosted by Lindsay Graham.</p>
<p><a href="https://wondery.com/shows/american-history-tellers/">American History Tellers:</a> This show has 4-6 episode seasons detailing various aspects of American History. This show got me my 5 in APUSH.</p>
<p><a href="https://wondery.com/shows/american-scandal/">American Scandal:</a> This podcast is similar to American History Tellers, except it deals with the more uncomfey or bad aspects of American History.</p><br>
</div>

<h2>Misc. Podcasts</h2>
<p>I listen to quite a few podcasts on random topics, such as strange Wikipedia entries and defining obscure topics!</p>

<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
  <h4>My Misc. Podcasts</h4>
  <p><a href="https://rebelforceradio.com">Rebel Force Radio:</a> This podcast, hosted by Jason Swank and Jimmy Mac, goes into extreme depth on all things Star Wars, which is perfect for a Star Wars nerd like me. They make 2hr+ podcast episodes after every single Star Wars episode drops, and they also have a weekly show with more broad Star Wars content.</p>
  <p><a href="https://relay.fm/ungeniused">Ungeniused:</a> A short podcast that covers weird and wacky Wikipedia Topics, hosted by Myke Hurley and Stephen Hackett</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/robot/">Robot or Not:</a> This show is a fun banter show where John Siracusa and Jason Snell debate if something is a robot or not, and has since expanded to deciding if X is Y or not, with various subjects.</p><br>

<h2 id="ranger">Junior Ranger Program</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
  <p>The Junior Ranger Program is a program at <a href="https://nps.gov">National Park Sites</a> that grants kids more opportunities to participate and learn about their National Parks. You complete a series of activities about the park in a workbook, and then show the completed activities to a Park Ranger. From there, you earn a Junior Ranger Badge and are a Junior Ranger of that National Park Site. I am a Junior Ranger at over 250 NPS Sites across the nation.</p><br>
