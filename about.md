<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
  <p>Every September, <a href="https://relay.fm">Relay</a> organizes a fundraiser for <a href="https://stjude.org">St. Jude Children's Research Hospital</a>. This fundraiser raises an incredible amount of money each year. Their lifetime total is over $4 Million raised over the last six years!</p>
  <p>In 2022, they opened the fundraiser up for individual community members to have their own sub-campaigns. I started a campaign, and in my campaign, for qualifying donations, I would mow their name into a lawn before cutting all the grass. I would dedicate that lawn to them and match a portion of their donation. My fundraiser raised $625. The link to the fundraiser is <a href="https://jdburch.com/2022">here</a>.</p>
  <p>During September 2023, I ran a similar campaign with Relay again. That year, my campaign raised $1,521.01, smashing my total from 2022 by nearly 3x. This link is <a href="https://jdburch.com/2023">here</a></p>
  <p>In 2024, I continued fundraising, this time with different rewards, and raised $2,147.11, bringing my lifetime total raised from my September fundraisers to $4,293.12. I am honored to raise money for such a fantastic organization, and plan to continue this fundraiser in the future years.</p>
  <p>In 2024, in my freshman year at the University of Michigan, I joined the board of the Friends for St. Jude club as Treasurer. I oversaw club finances and was heavily involved in planning and execution of the Friends for St. Jude's No More Cancer Rally in late April. This club-wide fundraiser raised $4049. In Fall 2025, I transitioned to the Vice President of Friends for St. Jude, where I am involved with the monthly meetings, fundraisers, and events.</p>
