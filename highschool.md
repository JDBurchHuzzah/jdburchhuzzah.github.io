<h2 id="day-band">Day Band</h2>

<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
  <h4>Symphony Band; Bass Clarinet</h4>
  <p>In 2022 and 2023 we earned a Division Rating II at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd1X7nPsM4Q">MSBOA</a> District Festival. My favorite song we have played is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeFiOnbKYcc">Danzon No. 2</a> by Arturo MÃ¡rquez, with a close second being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd1X7nPsM4Q">Stella Maris</a> by Samuel R. Hazo.</p><br>
  <h4>Concert Band; Tenor Saxophone</h4>
  <p>I joined Concert Band this year to learn and improve my Tenor Sax skills, as I will be auditioning for the University of Michigan Marching Band on Tenor Sax.</p><br>

<h2>Honors Bands & All state</h2>
<p>I was the First Chair Bass Clarinetest for the MSBOA District 4 Honors Band in 2024. I have participated in this honors band since it's return from Covid.</p>
<p>I also was accepted into the MSBOA All-State Band! This required a ridiculously hard audition, and I was auditioning against musicians across the state! I was accepted into the All-State Band on Contrabass Clarinet, and was first chair in 2024! This means I am the most skilled Contrabass Clarinetist in the state!.</p><br>

<h2>Marching Band</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
  <h4>High School Marching Band</h4>
  <p>I was a Captain of the Single Reeds Section in the SLEHS Marching Band, and play Bass Clarinet. Our marching band is in the <a href="https://www.themcba.org">MCBA</a> Flight II, and we were state finalists in 2021, 2022, and 2023</p><br>

  <h2>Small Ensembles</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
  <h4>Duets</h4>
  <p>In 2022, I played in a Clarinet and Bass Clarinet duet with a friend at MSBOA District and State Solo and Ensemble, earning a Division I Rating at both events.<br><br>In 2023, I played in a Bass Clarinet-Tenor Sax duet (I played Bass Clarinet) with another friend at MSBOA District and State Solo and Ensemble, earning a Division I Rating at both events as well.<br><br>In 2024, I played in a Clarinet-Bass Clarinet duet with yet another friend at District Solo and Ensemble. After a brief debacle that almost resulted in disqualification, we did end up earning a Division 1 Rating and going to State Solo and Ensemble.</p><br>
  <h4>Clarinet Choir</h4>
  <p>In Fall 2022, I joined our school sponsored Clarinet Ensemble. We performed at our school's Winter Concert, Spring Concert, and for a nursing home. We earned a 1 at District Solo and Ensemble, and unfortunately got disqualified at State Solo and Ensemble due to not covering all the parts in the piece; however, we did get glowing comments from the judge! This year, we preformed at District Solo and Ensemble, earning a 1 and thus going to States, as well as various concerts like last year.</p><br>
  <h4>Sax Choir</h4>
  <p>In Fall 2023, I joined Sax Choir to keep improving on Tenor Sax! We will be performing at the same events as Clarinet Choir! We also earned a 1 at District Solo and Ensemble, and will be preforming at State Solo and Ensemble.</p><br>

<h2 id="swim">Swimming</h2>

<p>I was a Captain on the South Lyon Varsity Swim and Dive Team in the 2023-2024 season. I mainly swam the 100 Breastroke and the 100 Butterfly. I was  Varsity all 4 years of high school. In 2024, I made the MHSAA Division 1 State Cut in the 100 Butterfly, and I competed on March 8 and 9 in the 100 Butterfly and the 200 Medley Relay at States!</p>

<h2 id="scouts">Scouts - Youth</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;"> <h4>Trail to Eagle - Blue Troop</h4>
 
  <p>In 2019, I joined Blue Troop at Trail to Eagle. Trail to Eagle is a very unique summer camp that takes place once a week. Scouts from across Michigan and the country are seperated into one of eight differnet troops named after a color. I was in Blue Troop for 5 years as a youth. In 2021, I was asked to be a Junior Assistant Scoutmaster. I served as a JASM for two years. Trail to Eagle 2022 was one of the best weeks of my life! I earned over 25 merit badges over the 4 years I was at TTE!</p><br>

  <div style="margin-left: 25px;"> <h4>Eagle Scout Project</h4>
    <p>In the summer of 2022, I completed my Eagle Scout Project. This patio was just under 100 square feet. It took months of planning and around 75 hours of personal service. I fundraised by organizing a can drive during the week of the Fourth of July on my grandma's street (she lives on a lake, so it was a great location). I also got funds from Thrivent Credit Union through a member of my church.</p><br></div>
